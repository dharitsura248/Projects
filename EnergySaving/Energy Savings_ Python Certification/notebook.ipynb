For example, aluminum can manufacturers can skip the energy-costly process of producing aluminum from ore by cleaning and melting recycled cans. Aluminum is classified as a non-ferrous metal.</p>\n","<p>Singapore has an ambitious goal of becoming a zero-waste nation. The amount of waste disposed of in Singapore has increased seven-fold over the last 40 years. At this rate, Semakau Landfill, Singaporeâ€™s only landfill, will run out of space by 2035. Making matters worse, Singapore has limited land for building new incineration plants or landfills.</p>\n","<p>The government would like to motivate citizens by sharing the total energy that the combined recycling efforts have saved every year. They have asked you to help them.</p>\n","<p>You have been provided with three datasets. The data come from different teams, so the names of waste types may differ.</p>\n","<div style=\"background-color: #efebe4; color: #05192d; text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; padding: 15px 25px 15px 25px; line-height: 1.6;\">\n","    <div style=\"font-size:16px\"><b>datasets/wastestats.csv - Recycling statistics per waste type for the period 2003 to 2017</b>\n","    </div>\n","    <div>Source: <a href=\"https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/waste-statistics-and-overall-recycling\">Singapore National Environment Agency</a></div>\n","<ul>\n","    <li><b>waste_type: </b>The type of waste recycled.</li>\n","    <li><b>waste_disposed_of_tonne: </b>The amount of waste that could not be recycled (in metric tonnes).</li>\n","    <li><b>total_waste_recycle_tonne: </b>The amount of waste that could be recycled (in metric tonnes).</li>\n","    <li><b>total_waste_generated: </b>The total amount of waste collected before recycling (in metric tonnes).</li>\n","    <li><b>recycling_rate: </b>The amount of waste recycled per tonne of waste generated.</li>\n","    <li><b>year: </b>The recycling year.</li>\n","</ul>\n","    </div>\n","<div style=\"background-color: #efebe4; color: #05192d; text-align:left; vertical-align: middle; padding: 15px 25px 15px 25px; line-height: 1.6; margin-top: 17px;\">\n","    <div style=\"font-size:16px\"><b>datasets/2018_2019_waste.csv - Recycling statistics per waste type for the period 2018 to 2019</b>\n","    </div>\n","    <div> Source: <a href=\"https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/waste-statistics-and-overall-recycling\">Singapore National Environment Agency</a></div>\n","<ul>\n","    <li><b>Waste Type: </b>The type of waste recycled.</li>\n","    <li><b>Total Generated: </b>The total amount of waste collected before recycling (in thousands of metric tonnes).</li> \n","    <li><b>Total Recycled: </b>The amount of waste that could be recycled.
