    "You have been hired as a data scientist at a used car dealership in the UK. The sales team have been having problems with pricing used cars that arrive at the dealership and would like your help. Before they take any company wide action they would like you to work with the Toyota specialist to test your idea. They have already collected some data from other retailers on the price that a range of Toyota cars were listed at. It is known that cars that are more than Â£1500 above the estimated price will not sell. The sales team wants to know whether you can make predictions within this range.\n",
    "\n",
    "The presentation of your findings should be targeted at the Head of Sales, who has no technical data science background.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data you will use for this analysis can be accessed here: `\"data/toyota.csv\"`"
